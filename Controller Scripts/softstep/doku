the name of the current page is shown on the display and when switching between pages its also shown on the screen, so you don't have to look down to your controller panel when switching pages.

Transport mode 
In this mode the buttons can be used to start and stop the current project, activate loop mode and toggle various recording modes. You can also start the device/clip/sample/preset-browser or tap your tempo.

Parameter mode 
in parameter mode you can change values of the currently selected device by usin the arrow keys on your softstep 2. Each softstep button is mapped to one parameter, the up and down key of the button can be used to increase or decrease the values by 10 and the left and right buttons can be used to increase and decrease the value by 1 - this is usefull if a parameter is mapped to a descret value like a program change on a hardware synth for example

The button number 5 can be used to switch between parameter banks on the selected devcie 

and button 0 is used to navigate between devices in the currently selected channel.
